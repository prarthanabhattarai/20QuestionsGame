# 20QuestionsGame
This is an implementation of the game 20 Questions

To play the game, user thinks of something (in this case, a country), then the computer asks a series of yes/no questions to try to determine which country she is thinking of.

There are two versions to this game: in the first version, the choice is pre-specified, the user has to choose from the list given; in the second version, there is no list to choose from, so the choice of country is unrestricted.

How to run the program:
Download the folder to desktop.
Open Eclipse and import the folder to workspace.
Run the file GameApplication.java; it is found at 20QuestionsGame/src/GameApplication.java
